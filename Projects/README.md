Mathematical models are at the heart of all data science applications such as information searching (Google), machine learning (e.g., face recognition algorithms), airline-crew scheduling, social network analysis, and more.
This course discusses the mathematics used in the analysis of data and the models used to make optimal decisions. Methods include advanced linear algebra, graph theory, optimization, probability, and geometry. These are some of the mathematical tools necessary for the data classification, machine learning, clustering and pattern recognition and for planning scheduling, and ranking.

### Syllabus:

- **Project 1.** (weeks 1-2) Linear Algebra models for Ranking and Learning from Data. 
Eigenvalues and Singular Value Decompositions, basic graph theory for Network analysis and ranking. Modeling who is top-ranked.

HOMEWORK: The recognition of a hand-written digit or ranking of electoral votes Analysis of text-documents through networks.

- **Project 2.** (weeks 3-4) Convex Optimization models for Supervised learning and decisions.
First steps on optimization models: linear & quadratic models. Data Fitting/Regression vs sparse regression, Support vector Machines, LASSO, convex optimization basics. HOMEWORK: Diagnosis of cancer through Support vector machines. More on text-mining, identifying keywords of an author.

- **Project 3.** (weeks 5-6-7) Discrete Models 
Integer programming, discrete optimization techniques: Scheduling, Optimal Packing bins and bags. Stable assignment problems. Homework Routing problems (shortest path), Scheduling and transportation problems (job/transplant allocation). HOMEWORK: Sudoku solver, Network analysis (shortest paths), knapsack.
